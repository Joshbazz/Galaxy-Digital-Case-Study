* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

In 2018, Galaxy started with a simple idea: Bring institutions into the blockchain revolution. Crypto was largely untouched by institutions then. The infrastructure at the time was capable of only accommodating early adopters and a nascent retail market. Less than five years later, crypto has grown exponentially. Big institutions and companies have entered the space. Projects like DeFi and NFTs have created new value propositions, use cases, and sectors of the digital economy. Galaxy has stood at the forefront of this revolution, building a suite of products, technology, and infrastructure that connects institutions, builders, and entrepreneurs to all points of the crypto economy.

The idea for Galaxy came about in order to bring institutions into the blockchain era. At a time when infrastructure buildouts were low and only capable of sustaiing early adopters and a small retail market, Galaxy Digital aimed to bring institutional investors from the traditional financial markets into the fold. Now the cryptocurrency landscape has increased exponentially, due to innovations like DeFi and NFTs, which are driving new value propositions and creating new sectors within the digital asset ecosystem. Galaxy has built a suite of products, technology and infrastructure that helps connect previously fragmented industry players, such as institutions, builders, and entrepreneurs.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Galaxy Digital operates multiple business lines within the cryptocurrency industry. Their three main business lines are Global Markets, Asset Management, and Digital Infrastructure Solutions. Offerings provided under these three main business segments include Trading, Lending, Strategic Advisory Services, Institutional-Grade Investment Solutions, Proprietary Bitcoin Mining and Hosting Services, and the development of Enterprise Custodial Technology   


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company's intended customers are tailored to Traditional Finance and Cryptocurrency Market participants, such as Institutional Investors, Trading Firms, Hedge Funds, Banks and FMIs, Founder and Web3 Entrepreneurs ($6.63B), and Miners ($5.01B). While the overall size of the global market size of Institutional Investors, which can be defined to contain also Trading Firms, Hedge Funds, Banks and FMIs can be difficult to evaluate, current research indicates a figure of around ~$61T to be a reasonable estimate. With estimations further purporting that these Institutional Investors can be expected to invest 5% of AUM over the next 5 years, using a conservative estimate of 0.50% of AUM for the current market environment leads to a theoretical market size of $305B. Combing this figure with the current research estimates of the figures for Web3 Entrepreneurs and Miners leads to a total addressable market size of around $316.64B. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

In a very new and massively understood industry, Galaxy Digital offers high quality solutions across multiple business segments that may cater to the needs of Individual Founders, SMEs, and Institutional Clients. These different customers may find added value across multiple business segments offered by the same firm, introducing a streamlined process for operations and services which provide continuity and peace of mind in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. For example, a company may fall into a Founder and Web3 Entrepreneur category, and utilize funding and or services tailored to this sort of customer base, while also being involved in Mining, and benefit from utilizing Galaxy as a provider for both Capital Injection and Mining Hosting capabilities.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    - Algorithmic Trading Solutions for on-chain trading, Institutional DeFi trading solutions combined with custodial services and OTC Trading solutions
    - Provide companies with the ability to gain institutional grade access to DeFi Ecosystems 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    - Offering a solution to DeFi Trading with an Institutional Grade bend is highly desirable for companies looking to access the truly decentralized markets while also having the capability to utilize other product offerings which can be more tailored to Traditional Finance or Mining Opoerations
    - Perhaps a Mining Company would like to Programmatically provide liquidity on DeFi exchanges with the Bitcoin they generate, in order to generate more yield and return Positive Expected Value over Mining Return to their investors

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    - Smart Contract Development, Oracle Solutions, Algorithmic Trading Solutions, Custodial Technology Integrations, GUI Platform for Client-based Asset Management, OTC DeFi Trading Solutions (execution algorithms for smart order routing)

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    - These technologies provide a framework for an end-to-end solution for the Client that will result in a platform and Trading Environment conducive to interacting with the DeFi markets. Smart contract development is necessary to programmatically interact with the on-chain ecosystems being targeted. Smart Contracts will be necessary for holding large amounts of coins on-chain. Oracle Solutions are necessary for accurate and timely information delivered between the Traditional Financial markets and assets living on-chain. Algorithmic Trading Solutions are needed in order to parse information from the Client's accounts, ingest and intepret data received from Oracles, generate Buy/Sell/Hold signals based off the parsing of these data points, as well as providing algorithms for instructing on-chain Smart Contracts on how to execute trades on these Signals. Custodial Technology Solutions are paramount for the safe handling of Client Funds when being deployed in a highly unregulated and volatile market, where hacks are still unfortunately a very real risk that needs robust solutions for mitigation. GUI Platform accessibility will give the Client more fine-grained control over their funds and let them more intuitively choose how to deploy their capital and execute trades. OTC DeFi Trading Solutions are necessary in order to obfuscate Order Blocks via Smart Order Routing and other Programmatic Execution Solutions in order to reduce slippage and overall impact on the markets being traded.
