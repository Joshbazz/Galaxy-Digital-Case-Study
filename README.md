* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

In 2018, Galaxy started with a simple idea: Bring institutions into the blockchain revolution. Crypto was largely untouched by institutions then. The infrastructure at the time was capable of only accommodating early adopters and a nascent retail market. Less than five years later, crypto has grown exponentially. Big institutions and companies have entered the space. Projects like DeFi and NFTs have created new value propositions, use cases, and sectors of the digital economy. Galaxy has stood at the forefront of this revolution, building a suite of products, technology, and infrastructure that connects institutions, builders, and entrepreneurs to all points of the crypto economy.
