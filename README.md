### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
- The idea for Galaxy came about in order to bring institutions into the blockchain era. At a time when infrastructure buildouts were low and only capable of sustaining early adopters and a small retail market, Galaxy Digital aimed to bring institutional investors from the traditional financial markets into the fold. Now the cryptocurrency landscape has increased exponentially, due to innovations like DeFi and NFTs, which are driving new value propositions and creating new sectors within the digital asset ecosystem. Galaxy has built a suite of products, technology and infrastructure that helps connect previously fragmented industry players, such as institutions, builders, and entrepreneurs.

    1. Series B led by HCM Capital in February of 2018 for $18 million
    2. Post-IPO Equity investment led by Founder Mike Novogratz in January of 2019 for $5 million
    3. Post-IPO Debt funding round with notable investors of Senator Investment Group and Arca for $500 million in November of 2021

- The company formally went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange on August 3rd, 2018.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
- Galaxy Digital operates multiple business lines within the cryptocurrency industry. Their three main business lines are Global Markets, Asset Management, and Digital Infrastructure Solutions 
    * Offerings provided under these three main business segments include Trading, Lending, Strategic Advisory Services, Institutional-Grade Investment Solutions, Proprietary Bitcoin Mining and Hosting Services, and the development of Enterprise Custodial Technology   


### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
- The company's intended customers are tailored to Traditional Finance and Cryptocurrency Market participants, such as Institutional Investors, Trading Firms, Hedge Funds, Banks and FMIs, Founder and Web3 Entrepreneurs ($6.63B), and Miners ($5.01B). 
- While the overall size of the global market size of Institutional Investors, which can be defined to contain also Trading Firms, Hedge Funds, Banks and FMIs can be difficult to evaluate, current research indicates a figure of around ~$61 trillion USD to be a reasonable estimate.
- With estimations further purporting that these Institutional Investors can be expected to invest 5% of AUM over the next 5 years, using a conservative estimate of 0.50% of AUM for the current market environment leads to a theoretical market size of $305 billion USD. Combining this figure with the current research estimates of the figures for Web3 Entrepreneurs and Miners leads to a total addressable market size of around $316.64B. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
- In a very new and massively understood industry, Galaxy Digital offers high quality solutions across multiple business segments that may cater to the needs of Individual Founders, SMEs, and Institutional Clients. 
- These different customers may find added value across multiple business segments offered by the same firm, introducing a streamlined process for operations and services which provide continuity and peace of mind in a rapidly evolving industry landscape, where trust and transparency in the service provider is paramount. 
    - For example, a company may fall into a Founder and Web3 Entrepreneur category, and utilize funding and or services tailored to this sort of customer base, while also being involved in Mining, and benefit from utilizing Galaxy as a provider for both Capital Injection and Mining Hosting capabilities, and further utilize Galaxy's trading solutions to buy and sell their newly minted coins in the open markets.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
- Galaxy provides multiple different technology solutions for their Clients. While the majority of their financial product offerings are navigated in a best-practices mindset utilized by the broader Financial Services Company industry, their more technical offerings are specified in the Trading, Custody, Bitocin Mining and Hosting, and Validator Services product lines. 
- Furthermore, per Galaxy's Q3 2023 Report, Galaxy is actively working on development of GalaxyOne, a unified technology platform for institutional investors. This client-centric solution aims to be the single access point to services and products across the digital access ecosystem, further streamlining the integration that can be utilized by Galaxy's Clients as they may have bespoke needs to use multiple product offerings at once for their business needs.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
- I would encourage a cross-product solution that builds upon current offerings and also taps into the expanding Decentralized Finance ecosystem via Algorithmic Trading Solutions that can be utilized by standalone clients, or more specifically, clients who are using Galaxy's Hosted Mining solutions
- For this product, a Client would be able to generate extra value from their newly minted coins by deploying them on-chain for liquidity provision. This would provide a further use-case for Galaxy's recent acquisition of the Helios Mining Facility in Texas, while providing customers who are using this product offering with an easy to use system that can benefit from generating yield via staking or liqiduity provision in the DeFi markets, where market makers who provide liquidity to Decentralized Exchanges are compensated for doing so and are an absolute necessity.
- Furthermore, this new product could tap into Galaxy's GK8 Enterprise-Grade Custody Solution, which would give Clients peace of mind knowing that their assets are being looked after with professional techonology. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
- The product mentioned above would provide a new avenue for Insitutional Investors and Miners to interact with on-chain ecosystems, which would boost these markets overall. Since Galxy also operates Validator nodes and infrastructure soltions, they will indirectly benefit from the increased activity on-chain, which will further increase security of the chains in questions, providing value back to their validator nodes in the form of an increase in Revenue from the uptick in transaction volumes. 
- This product offering could also interact with Galaxy's spot and derivatives trading business lines, providing value to the Client who will need to interact with off-chain exchanges as well, in addition to boosting trading revenue to Galaxy. 
- This could also be integrated with GalaxyOne, the aforementioned all-in-one technology platform currently under development, so Clients will be able to handle the On-Chain, Off-Chain, and management of Custodied assets not being deployed in the open markets by themselves.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
- In order for this product to work, numerous technologies would need to be utlized, including Smart Contracts for handling on-chain transactions, Oracle Solutions for providing accurate and timely data to the Smart Contracts, Algorithmic Trading Solutions for automated execution of orders when specified conditions are met, custodial solutions for adequately managing risk when capital is not deployed, and OTC Trading Solutions for converting coins utilized on-chain back into the Client's preferred fiat currency.


### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
- These technologies provide a framework for an end-to-end solution for the Client that will result in a platform and Trading Environment conducive to interacting with the DeFi markets. Smart contract development is necessary to programmatically interact with the on-chain ecosystems being targeted. Smart Contracts will be necessary for holding large amounts of coins on-chain, while Oracle Solutions are necessary for accurate and timely information delivered between the Traditional Financial markets and assets living on-chain. 
- Algorithmic Trading Solutions are needed in order to parse information from the Client's accounts, ingest and intepret data received from Oracles, generate Buy/Sell/Hold signals based off the parsing of these data points, as well as providing algorithms for instructing on-chain Smart Contracts on how to execute trades on these Signals. 
- Custodial Technology Solutions are paramount for the safe handling of Client Funds when being deployed in a highly unregulated and volatile market, where hacks are still unfortunately a very real risk that needs robust solutions for mitigation. 
- GUI Platform accessibility will give the Client more fine-grained control over their funds and let them more intuitively choose how to deploy their capital and execute trades. 
- OTC DeFi Trading Solutions are necessary in order to obfuscate Order Blocks via Smart Order Routing and other Programmatic Execution Solutions in order to reduce slippage and overall impact on the markets being traded.
