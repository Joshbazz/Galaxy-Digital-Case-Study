## Unprocessed notes from online sources to be included in the main case study

* To-Do:
    - Go deeper on Galaxy's website to get more fine-tuned answers and understanding of their product offerings
    - Research major trends and innovations in Cryptocurrency MArkets over the last 5-10 years. Try and focus on trends that serve the purpose of circling back to Galaxy's current product offerings
    - Research Competitors. Start with DGC and A16z. Try and Identify where Galaxy is deriving most of their Revenue from, and search for competitors there. I'm assuming that this may further the competitive landscape into Traditional Asset Managers who are looking into Digital Asset Solutions as well.
    - Research and find instances with facts and figures related to Galaxy's business impact so far. I'm thinking this will end up relating to major Contracts with Miners, Growth of AUM, numerical figures related to Trading Volumes and PnL, as well as notable home-runs on Venture Investments
