## Unprocessed notes from online sources to be included in the main case study

* To-Do:
    - Go deeper on Galaxy's website to get more fine-tuned answers and understanding of their product offerings
    - Research major trends and innovations in Cryptocurrency MArkets over the last 5-10 years. Try and focus on trends that serve the purpose of circling back to Galaxy's current product offerings
    - Research Competitors. Start with DGC and A16z. Try and Identify where Galaxy is deriving most of their Revenue from, and search for competitors there. I'm assuming that this may further the competitive landscape into Traditional Asset Managers who are looking into Digital Asset Solutions as well.
    - Research and find instances with facts and figures related to Galaxy's business impact so far. I'm thinking this will end up relating to major Contracts with Miners, Growth of AUM, numerical figures related to Trading Volumes and PnL, as well as notable home-runs on Venture Investments

- "Digital Infrastructure Solutions" -> Building to bring your world on-chain
    - "Galaxy build and invest in technology that powers the digital assets ecosystem, with a focus on scalability and security. We are an industry leader in proprietary bitcoin mining and hosting services (look into this), critical network validator services, and the development of enterprise-grade custodial technology
    1. Mining
        - Galaxy's mining business consists of proprietary and hosted bitcoin mining
        - Galaxy is growing its hashrate under management (That's a super interesting way to measure, research), across both hosting and proprietary sites across North America, with the majority at our flagshipsite, Helios, in West Texas (find out more about Helios, maybe tie in to proposing how to offer programmatic on-chain dewfi solutions for generating yield on created bitcoin in the defi ecosystems)
    2. Emerging Opportunities
        - Galaxy offers self custody technology solutions through GK8. We are focused on expanding access to GK8 products globally with a product roadmap (<- find it) that prioritizes unparalleled security nd flexible ecosystem interactions
        - Galaxy is focused on emerging areas of blockchain infrastructure, inclduing supporting the integrity of protocols and ecosystem projects by operating validator nodes to secure blockchains
    3. Key Metrics
        - Mining
            - 309 -> Proprietary BTC Mined (how many have dedicated mining companies mined?)
            - < $0 Average MArginal cost to mine (are the using renewables?) 
            - 3.9 EH/s^2 -> hashrate under management (HUM)
            - 4 EH/s^2 -> 2023 Year-end HUM target (3% growth? seems small)
        - Emerging Opportunities
            - 10+ protocols supported in Galaxy Validator solutions (ok, which ones?)
            - 16 GK8 Total Client count (what is this relative to other Enterprise-grade custody solutions? this means nothing by itself)

- "Sustainability" (one of my assumed global trends, this could be worth looking into)
    - Galaxies ESG Program => "Galaxy is committed to responsible environmental, social, and governance practices as we build our global business and help shape a new economic paradigm"
    - Program Structure:
        1. Environmental:
            - Managing our environmental and carbon footprint by integrating sustainable practices across our operations (...like what?)
        2. Social:
            - Fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture for broader crypto community 
        3. Governance:
            - Establishing strong corporate governance to maintain a culture of integrity
    - ESG Materiality Assessment
        - Galaxy implemented its first biennial ESG materiality assessment to identify and prioritize focus areas, shape the Program strategy, and ensure that future reporting addresses ESG issues of greatest importance
    ***I wonder if theres any ESG stuff around their mining operations. It'd be interesting to see them converting or utilizing renewables at their Helios operation*
